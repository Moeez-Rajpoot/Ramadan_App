It is always held on the 9th month of the Islamic lunar calendar â€” a calendar that is based on the phases of the moon.
The 12 months of this calendar add up to 354 days: 11 days shorter than the standard Gregorian calendar.
Because of this, the Islamic Lunar calendar moves backwards 11 days each year.
So, every year, the first day of Ramadan falls 11 days earlier. "

During its 29 to 30 days, Muslims fast every day from sunrise to sunset.

When the sun sets, there is a communal meal called Iftar where you break your fast, typically with your family or friends.

But the month of Ramadan is about more than just fasting.

Doing good deeds such as charity, increasing your generosity and abstaining from sinful acts, such as gossip, are all important traits of Ramadan.

It is a month of self-reflection and a way for Muslims to develop positive habits that can be continued and encouraged once Ramadan is over."

While her typical Ramadan practices would involve going to mosques and households with family and friends, 2022 will be different.
This year, Ramadan will be a little lonely, she said. I'll miss the community events we would go to in Melbourne, she said.
In a way, the 2021 lockdown was good because it meant my whole family was at home.We got to break fast together, without getting caught up in work or any distractions.

Ending a month of fasting, Muslims celebrate with a three-day festival called Eid al-Fitr, or Festival of Breaking the Fast, and wish each other Eid Mubarak meaning: Have a blessed Eid.
During Eid, Muslims have family, friends and neighbours over, indulging them in a feast and eating traditional foods only made during this time.
My favourite thing about Ramadan is breaking fast together and celebrating Eid at the end of the month, Zathia said.
We get to wear cultural clothing, exchange gifts and be around family."

Those participating will usually wake up early to eat a big meal so that they won't be hungry throughout the day.
And those who don't wake up early have a big dinner before going to bed.
It's important to note that not every Muslim will fast this Ramadan. Young children and the elderly are exempt from fasting, along with those who are:
Sick
Pregnant
Nursing
Menstruating
Travelling long distances
But what happens if you miss a fast? You can make up for it by fasting at a later date.
If you can't fast because of health reasons, it is encouraged you donate food or money to the poor instead. "
